MEC 572: Final Project
Team 2: Steven Zilg, Austin Henthorne 

The following zip includes:
The final paper in latex format, with the pdf included along with all necessary files (pictures, etc)
The final presentation in powerpoint format
A pure executable file that allows you to run the software without recompiling the underlying program (Final implemntation)
The program files which include all files necessary to compile the program


For the executable file:
The input file for the spatial displacements has to be a .txt file which needs to be in the same folder as the .exe file
We also have three example inputs labeled as: Which already exist in the folder so can be ran by just calling them in the "Input Filename" 
input.txt
input2.txt
input3.txt

*To obtain a default configuration of 4 spatial displacements, check the uploaded file box.

GUI:
The desired curve can be implied by clicking the checkbox.
The degree of the curve is controlled by the + and - buttons as well as the control points.
*To obtain an interpolation curve, the control points must be set to the data points*
The resolution (or number of points along the curve) is controlled by the slider.
When the hyperspherical radius box is unchecked, the value of R for the polar decomposition method is calculated using the default equation (R=24L/pi)
To change the hyperspherical radius, check the corresponding box and use the increment/decrement cvalue to increase or decrease the calue of R.
